// Description: Queues and pumps a live-observer session (see docs/live-observer-feature.md).
// Joining a livestream is a two-step affair that no single screen can own: the intent is
// recorded from whichever screen picked the game, and the connect-then-start-playback
// sequence is pumped by whichever screen the player is standing on when it completes. This
// module holds that state machine so no menu has to.

///
/// Only records the intent. The connection blocks on the relay's HEADER and then starts a
/// game, neither of which may happen while a screen is still animating — so the screen the
/// player lands on performs it, via LiveObserverStartPendingSession() below.
/// password is the password of a password-protected stream (sent with the watch-ticket
/// request); displayName is the lobby's name, used to title the password reprompt popup.
/// delaySeconds is the lobby's broadcast delay (-1 = unknown): it pre-seeds the countdown
/// and join timeout until GO's admission hold or the relay's ROLE pins the real value.
